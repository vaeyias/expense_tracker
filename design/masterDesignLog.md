# Design Log

## Major Design Changes from Assignment 2

- In Assignment 2, I had a PersonalExpenseTracker concept and GroupExpenseTracker concept. In this iteration, I merged the two concepts into a single Expense concept and introduce a new indepedent Group concept for handling user groupings:
  - Expense Concept
  - Group Concept
- As per the feedback, I will not be implementing the Friendship concept as it is not too essential to the core functionailty of my app
- To narrow the project scope as recommended, I have chosen to implement the Folder concept instead of both Folder and Budget concepts.
