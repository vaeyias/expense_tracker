I first attempted to implement the Expense concept. Based on feedback from Assignment 2, I refactored the PersonalExpenseTracker, GroupExpenseTracker concepts into one Expense concept and a Group concept. I used LLM to help me create and implement the Expense concept from my two previous concepts:
[concept.8c8b9306](../../../context/design/brainstorming/expense_concept_brainstorm.md/steps/concept.8c8b9306.md)

 As I was testing the Expense concept, I realized that the LLM omitted some the requirements I had in my concept like "all values in debtMapping sum to totalCost". So, I fixed these definitions and reran the code
