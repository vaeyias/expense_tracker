# Folder Design Log
After using the LLM to implement my Folder concept, it caught an action I forgot to specify:
-  moveFolder action that changes the parentFolder of the folder. So, I updated my Folder concept to include this: [concept](../../../context/design/concepts/Folder/Folder.md/steps/_.e3ce964d.md)

**No other major design changes/issues so far.**
