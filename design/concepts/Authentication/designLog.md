# Authentication Design Log

- implemented in assignment 4
- integrated the User concept into the Authentication concept: handle display names and editing display names.
- Assignment 4c: added a token to Authentication concept to actually authenticate the user. When a user logs in, they are given a random token that is used to authenticate the user to do certain actions. When the user logs out, this token is removed.
