Based on the feedback from Assignment 2, I  integrated the expense aspects of my PersonalExpenseTracker and GroupExpenseTracker concepts into one Expense concept that keeps track of all expenses. I used an LLM to help with this:

[LLM Concept](../../../context/design/brainstorming/expense_concept_brainstorm.md/steps/concept.8c8b9306.md)

And then edited the concept manually:

[Modified Concept](../../../context/design/concepts/Expense/Expense.md/steps/concept.811ad7ba.md)


Another small change I made from Assignment 2 is I added a creator field to Expenses. Originally, I only included a payer and assumed the creator of the expense was the payer. However, after developing test cases, I decided to allow creators of expenses to designate other users as payers of an expense.

I used LLM to help me implement the concept, but I noticed that the LLM did not include any validation of the requirements that were specified in the conept specification:

 [LLM implementation](../../../context/design/concepts/Expense/implementation.md/steps/response.b69c987d.md)

  So, I manually added these to the implementation:
 [Fixed Implementation](../../../context/design/concepts/Expense/implementation.md/steps/_.79e37ee7.md)


 I also did not personally like the test file generated by the LLM because it was hard to read the outputs:

 [LLM Test File](../../../context/design/concepts/Expense/testing.md/steps/response.3c927e51.md)

 So I did some styling changes to make it more readable. I edited some test cases that I thought were not meaningful. Additionally, I noticed the LLM implemented a helper function that was never used so it was removed:

[modified test file](../../../context/design/concepts/Expense/testing.md/steps/_.68ae5135.md)

The last change I made to the implementation and test files were returning errors instead of throwing errors:

[test file](../../../context/design/concepts/Expense/testing.md/steps/_.c2c0de5a.md)

[implementation file](../../../context/design/concepts/Expense/implementation.md/steps/_.7b4475ef.md)
