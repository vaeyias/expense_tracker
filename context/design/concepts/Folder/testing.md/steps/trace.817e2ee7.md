# trace:

The trace demonstrates the creation, modification, and deletion of folders, including scenarios like adding and removing groups, renaming folders, and handling edge cases such as duplicate names or non-existent entities.

* **Create Folder:** Alice creates a folder named "Alice's Docs." The system confirms its creation and verifies its properties.
* **Duplicate Folder Name:** Alice attempts to create another folder with the same name, which should result in an error.
* **Missing Fields:** Attempts to create a folder without a valid owner or name are made to ensure error handling.
* **Add Group:** A folder "My Files" is created, and `group1` is added to it. The system verifies that `group1` is now in the folder.
* **Add Existing Group:** `group1` is added again to "Existing Group Folder" to ensure idempotency.
* **Add to Non-existent Folder:** An attempt is made to add a group to a folder that does not exist, expecting an error.
* **Add to Another User's Folder:** An attempt is made to add a group to a folder owned by Alice, but from Bob's perspective, expecting an error.
* **Remove Group:** A folder "Removable Folder" is created with `group1` and `group2`. `group1` is then removed, and the system verifies that only `group2` remains.
* **Remove Non-existent Group:** An attempt is made to remove a group that is not in "Emptyish Folder," expecting an error.
* **Remove from Non-existent Folder:** An attempt is made to remove a group from a folder ID that does not exist, expecting an error.
* **Remove from Another User's Folder:** An attempt is made to remove a group from Alice's folder, but from Bob's perspective, expecting an error.
* **Delete Empty Folder:** An empty folder "Empty Folder" is created and then deleted, verifying its removal.
* **Delete Folder with Groups:** A folder "Folder With Groups" is created with `group1` and `group2`. Alice's root folder is also created. The folder with groups is then deleted, and the system verifies that the groups have been moved to Alice's root folder.
* **Delete Another User's Folder:** An attempt is made to delete Alice's folder from Bob's account, expecting an error.
* **Rename Folder:** A folder "Old Name" is renamed to "New Name," and the system confirms the name change.
* **Rename to Existing Name:** A folder "Another Folder" is attempted to be renamed to "Existing Name" (which already exists for Alice), expecting an error.
* **Rename Non-existent Folder:** An attempt is made to rename a folder ID that does not exist, expecting an error.
* **Rename Another User's Folder:** An attempt is made to rename Alice's folder from Bob's account, expecting an error.
* **Delete Folder with No Root:** Bob creates a folder "Bob's Folder With Groups" with `group3`. All of Bob's root folders are then deleted. The folder with groups is deleted, and the system checks that a warning is logged to the console indicating no root folder was found, and that `group3` is not present in any of Bob's remaining folders.
