# Error-handling

ALL normal errors should be caught, and return a record `{error: "the error message"}` to allow proper future synchronization with useful errors. When implementating actions, be sure to return errors when requirements are not met. Be clear in error messages.

Be sure to handle return types by including `| { error: string }`. For example,
async function exampleAction(...): Promise<{ result: T } | { error: string }> { ... }

```
concept User
    purpose provides a unique identity for each person using the application
    principle a user is created with a username
    state
        a set of Users with
            a username String
            a displayName String

    actions
        createUser(username:String, displayName:String): (user:User)
            requires username is unique
            effect creates a new user profile with the given username and display name

          deleteUser(user:User):
            requires user exists
            effect deletes the user profile from the system

        getUserById(user:User): (userInfo:User)
            requires user exists
            effect returns the profile information of the user

```
